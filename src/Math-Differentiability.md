## Differential Calculus Differentiability

Most of the real-world phenomena are related to rate of change of one quantity with respect to another, such as the velocity of a car, the number of bacteria in a culture, the inflation of currency, the shock of an earthquake, and the voltage of an electric signal. The rate of change is studied in one of the two parts of calculus, which is differentiation. In this lecture, you are going to learn the geometrical and analytical concepts of derivative and some of its applications. (Prerequisite: function, limit, continuity)

**Is the derivative really difficult?** Today, we will look at it simply. It's nothing, just a ratio, but a little tricky! Are you worried? Well, before that, let's solve the following geometry problem:

Find the tangent of the parabola \\( y^2=4x \\) at P(1, 2).
