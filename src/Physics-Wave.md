## Traveling wave

A wave can be described as a disturbance in a medium that travels transferring momentum and energy without any net motion of the medium. A wave in which the positions of maximum and minimum amplitude travel through the medium is known as a traveling wave.

## Progressive wave

Progressive wave are waves that is travelling continuously inside a medium of the same direction without any change in amplitude.

## Forced Oscillation

When a body oscillates by being influenced by an external periodic force, it is called forced oscillation. Here, the amplitude of oscillation, experiences damping but remains constant due to the external energy supplied to the system.

For example, when you push someone on a swing, you have to keep periodically pushing them so that the swing doesn't reduce.

## Damped Oscillation

The damping is the resistance offered to the oscillation. The oscillation that fades with time is called damped oscillation. Due to damping, the amplitude of oscillation reduces with time. Reduction in amplitude is the result of energy loss from the system in overcoming external forces like friction or air resistance and other resistive forces. Thus, with the decrease in amplitude, the energy of the system also keeps decreasing. There are two types of damping

- Natural Damping
- Artificial Damping

## Resonance

Oscillation of object with maximum amplitude, when the frequency of the applied force is equal to the natural frequency of the object is called resonance.

### When can resonance be observed?

When the frequency of the applied force is equal to the natural frequency of the object.

### Problems:
